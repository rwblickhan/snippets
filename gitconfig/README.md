# .gitconfig

A few settings I keep in my `.gitconfig`. Most notably:

* Use [`delta`](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) for `git diff`.
* Use `git b` as an alias for a fancy branch switcher using [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (h/t to my Asana colleague Theo Spears!).
* Use `git c` and `git cf` as an alias for diffing with `master` branch (with `--name-only` in the latter).
