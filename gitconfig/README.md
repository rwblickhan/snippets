# .gitconfig

A few settings I keep in my `.gitconfig`. Most notably:

* Use [`delta`](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) for `git diff`.
* Use `git b` as an alias for a fancy branch switcher using [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (h/t to my Asana colleague Theo Spears!).
* Use `git c` and `git cn` as an alias for diffing, using `fzf` to search branches, with `--name-only` in the latter.
* Use `git l` as an alias for a simpler one-line `git log` output.
* Use `git oops` as an alias to squash current changes with the last commit - useful when you commit and immediately notice a typo!.
